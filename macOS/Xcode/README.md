## 1. Introduction

This guide describes the steps needed to build the Eternal Lands client 
for macOS using Apple's integrated development environment, Xcode. 
The guide assumes some familiarity with the macOS build process, but 
efforts have been made to make the process as easy to follow as 
possible.

### Important Note

It is worth noting at this point that any app built by following this guide 
will run **on your local machine only** and **will not be distributable 
to other users unless it has been signed by a registered Apple 
Developer account and subsequently notarised by Apple**. Steps to 
achieve this have not been included in this guide as it is assumed that 
somebody in possession of a registered Apple Developer account will 
already be familiar with the process.

## 2. Prerequisites

To build the client for macOS you'll need both a relatively modern version 
of macOS and a recent release of Xcode. It is recommended that your 
build environment be running at least macOS 10.15.4 (Catalina), though 
11.0 (Big Sur) or later is preferable.

If you are planning to build a universal binary with native support for both 
x86_64 (Intel) and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) you will need to be running 
Xcode 12.2 or later. If you plan to build for x86_64 only, Xcode 11.4 or 
later is recommended.

Xcode can be obtained for free from the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). If you're new to Xcode it is 
highly recommended that you browse through the "Welcome" section 
of the [Xcode Help guide](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/) 
before proceeding.

## 3. Obtaining the Framework Pack

Before you can build the client, you will need to ensure that you have 
the correct frameworks available on your system.

You can obtain the latest framework pack directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/raduprv/Eternal-Lands/releases) of the 
Eternal Lands github. The framework pack will be listed as an asset for 
the latest source code release.

The file you are looking for will be named `el_1.9.6_macOS_frameworks_R2.zip`, 
or something very similar. Download and extract it somewhere that'll 
be easy for you to find.

Once extracted, you should have a folder named 
`el_1.9.6_macOS_frameworks_R2` which contains the *.framework 
files you will need to build the client.

## 4. Framework Location

The Xcode project has been configured to search for frameworks in the 
following location: `/Users/<accountname>/Library/Frameworks/`

While it is possible to change the search path, it is recommended that 
you copy the *.framework folders you downloaded in the previous step 
to this location **without modifying them**. If you do not already have 
a `Frameworks` folder in `/Users/<accountname>/Library`, it is safe 
to create it.

If copied correctly, the full path to each framework will be: `/Users/<accountname>/Library/Frameworks/<frameworkname>.framework`

Please note that if you are attempting to build from source that has been 
highly developed since the last client release you may find that you are 
missing some of the necessary frameworks to enable new features. If 
you have followed the above steps correctly and Xcode complains about 
missing headers, this is most likely to be the cause.

## 5. Obtaining the Client Source

The next step is to obtain the latest version of the client source. There 
are a number of ways to do this, though by far the easiest is to grab the 
client source directly from git using the following terminal commands:
```
cd ~/Desktop/
git clone https://github.com/raduprv/Eternal-Lands.git
```
This will place a folder on your desktop named `Eternal-Lands-master` 
which contains the most recent version of the client source. You won't 
need this quite yet, but keep it safe for now and **do not attempt to 
modify it**.

## 6. Obtaining the Data Pack

Before you can build the client, you will need to ensure that you have a 
local copy of the data pack for Xcode to insert into the .app bundle.

You can obtain the latest data pack directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/raduprv/Eternal-Lands/releases) of the Eternal 
Lands github. The data pack will be listed as an asset for the latest source 
code release.

The file you are looking for will be named `el_195_p*_data_files.zip`, 
or something very similar. Download and extract it somewhere that'll 
be easy for you to find.

Once you have extracted the files, it is **very important** that the main 
outer folder (the one **directly** containing `2dobjects`, `3dobjects`,
and a bunch of other stuff) be named `data`. If for whatever reason the 
outer folder you have is named something other than that, be sure to 
re-name it before continuing to the next step.

## 7. Open the Xcode Project

If you've made it this far, well done! It's finally time to open the Xcode 
project and start the really fun stuff.

You'll find the Xcode project file under `macosx` in the folder of source 
files you grabbed from git back in step 5. If you have Xcode installed 
correctly, double clicking `Eternal Lands.xcodeproj` should open 
the project window.

If you're new or not very familiar with Xcode then feel free to take this 
opportunity to browse around and take everything in. Don't worry if you 
mess anything up, you can always go back and repeat step 5 to start 
over with fresh source!

## 8. Setting the Data Pack Location

Unfortunately, because the data pack is maintained and distributed in a 
separate package, it isn't possible for us to pre-configure the path to it 
in the Xcode project for you. The good news is that this isn't too difficult 
to configure yourself, and it **should** be the final thing you need to do 
to before building the client!

1. Select the **Eternal Lands** target.

2. Select the **Build Phases** tab.

3. Expand the **Copy Files** build phase.

4. Select the current entry, `data`, and remove it by clicking the **-**.

5. Click the **+** and select the `data` folder you created back in step 5.

6. When the choose options window pops up, make sure **copy files is 
disabled** and **create folder references is enabled**.

7. Click finish.

If you have followed the above steps correctly, the path to the data folder 
on your Mac should now be correctly configured. You're ready to build!

## 9. Build (aka click to bake)

If all of the above steps have been followed correctly, building the client 
should now be a piece of cake. To start the build process you can either 
click the play icon at the top of the project window, or press 
**Command + B**.

The build process can take some time, but don't worry, this is normal. If 
everything works correctly (*Build Succeeded!*) you'll be able to find the 
complete app bundle in the following location: `/Users/<accountname>/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Eternal_Lands*/Build/Products/Release`
